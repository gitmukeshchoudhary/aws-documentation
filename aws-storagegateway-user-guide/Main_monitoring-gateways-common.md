# Monitoring Storage Gateway<a name="Main_monitoring-gateways-common"></a>

In this section, you can find information about how to monitor a gateway, including monitoring resources associated with the gateway and monitoring the upload buffer and cache storage\. You use the AWS Management Console to view metrics for your gateway\. For example, you can view the number of bytes used in read and write operations, the time spent in read and write operations, and the time taken to retrieve data from the AWS cloud\. With metrics, you can track the health of your gateway and set up alarms to notify you when one or more metrics fall outside a defined threshold\.

AWS Storage Gateway provides Amazon CloudWatch metrics at no additional charge\. Storage Gateway metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks\. By using these metrics, you can access historical information and get a better perspective on how your gateway and volumes are performing\. For detailed information about CloudWatch, see the *[Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)*\.

## Understanding Gateway Metrics<a name="MonitoringGateways-common"></a>

For the discussion in this topic, we define *gateway* metrics as metrics that are scoped to the gatewayâ€”that is, they measure something about the gateway\. Because a gateway contains one or more volumes, a gateway\-specific metric is representative of all volumes on the gateway\. For example, the `CloudBytesUploaded` metric is the total number of bytes that the gateway sent to the cloud during the reporting period\. This metric includes the activity of all the volumes on the gateway\.

When working with gateway metric data, you specify the unique identification of the gateway that you are interested in viewing metrics for\. To do this, you specify both the `GatewayId` and the `GatewayName` values\. When you want to work with metric for a gateway, you specify the gateway *dimension* in the metrics namespace, which distinguishes a gateway\-specific metric from a volume\-specific metric\. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics](monitoring-volume-gateway.md#UsingCloudWatchConsole-common)\.

## Dimensions for AWS Storage Gateway Metrics<a name="storagegateway-metric-dimensions"></a>

The Amazon CloudWatch namespace for the AWS Storage Gateway service is `AWS/StorageGateway`\. Data is available automatically in 5\-minute periods at no charge\. 


|  Dimension  |  Description  | 
| --- | --- | 
|  GatewayId, GatewayName |  These dimensions filter the data that you request to gateway\-specific metrics\. You can identify a gateway to work by the value for `GatewayId` or `GatewayName`\. If the name of your gateway was different for the time range that you are interested in viewing metrics, use the `GatewayId`\.   Throughput and latency data of a gateway is based on all the volumes for the gateway\. For information about working with gateway metrics, see [Measuring Performance Between Your Gateway and AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-gateway.html#PerfGatewayAWS-common)\.   | 
|  VolumeId  |  This dimension filters the data you request to volume\-specific metrics\. Identify a storage volume to work with by its `VolumeId` value\. For information about working with volume metrics, see [Measuring Performance Between Your Application and Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/monitoring-volume-gateway.html#PerfAppGateway-common)\.   | 

## Monitoring the Upload Buffer<a name="PerfUploadBuffer-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's upload buffer and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when the buffer exceeds a specified threshold\. By using this approach, you can add buffer storage to a gateway before it fills completely and your storage application stops backing up to AWS\.

You monitor the upload buffer in the same way in both the cached\-volume and tape gateway architectures\. For more information, see [How AWS Storage Gateway Works \(Architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\. 

**Note**  
The `WorkingStoragePercentUsed`, `WorkingStorageUsed`, and `WorkingStorageFree` metrics represent the upload buffer for stored volumes only before the release of the cached\-volume feature in Storage Gateway\. Now, use the equivalent upload buffer metrics `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree`\. These metrics apply to both gateway architectures\.


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Upload buffer usage |  Use the `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `UploadBufferUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the storage usage over a time period\.   | <a name="PerfUploadBufferMeasuring-common"></a>

**To measure the percent of the upload buffer that is used**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics** dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `UploadBufferPercentUsed` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\. 

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percent used of the upload buffer\.

Using the following procedure, you can create an alarm using the CloudWatch console\. To learn more about alarms and thresholds, see [Creating CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.<a name="GatewayAlarm1-common"></a>

## Monitoring Cache Storage<a name="PerfCache-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's cache storage and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when parameters of the cache pass specified thresholds\. Using this alarm, you know when to add cache storage to a gateway\.

You only monitor cache storage in the cached volumes architecture\. For more information, see [How AWS Storage Gateway Works \(Architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\. 


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Total usage of cache |  Use the `CachePercentUsed` and `TotalCacheSize` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `CachePercentUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the cache usage over a period of time\.  The `TotalCacheSize` metric changes only when you add cache to the gateway\.  | 
| Percent of read requests that are served from the cache |  Use the `CacheHitPercent` metric with the `Average` statistic\.  Typically, you want `CacheHitPercent` to remain high\.  | 
| Percent of the cache that is dirtyâ€”that is, it contains content that has not been uploaded to AWS |  Use the `CachePercentDirty` metrics with the `Average` statistic\.  Typically, you want `CachePercentDirty` to remain low\.  | <a name="PerfCacheDirtyMeasuring-common1"></a>

**To measure the percent of a cache that is dirty for a gateway and all its volumes**
